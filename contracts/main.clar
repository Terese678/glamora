;; @desc: This function lets creators share their fashion posts on Glamora, whether it's runway shows,
;; lookbooks, tutorials, behind-the-scenes content, or product reviews. Each post gets a unique ID number
;; and is stored permanently on the blockchain.

;; IPFS INTEGRATION:
;; I've built this function to work with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized content storage.
;; The content-hash parameter is a unique fingerprint of the fashion photo or video, while the ipfs-hash
;; parameter stores the actual IPFS link where the file lives. This means the content isn't stored directly
;; on the blockchain (that would be expensive), but the blockchain keeps a permanent record pointing to
;; where the content is stored on IPFS. If you don't have an IPFS hash yet, you can pass 'none' and add it later.

;; @params:
;; - title: The title of your fashion post (max 64 characters)
;; - description: Tell people about your post, styling tips, inspiration, etc (max 256 characters)
;; - content-hash: A unique 32-byte fingerprint of your content file for verification
;; - ipfs-hash: The IPFS address where your actual photo/video is stored (optional, can be none)
;; - category: What type of content this is (1=Fashion Show, 2=Lookbook, 3=Tutorial, 4=Behind-the-Scenes, 5=Review)
