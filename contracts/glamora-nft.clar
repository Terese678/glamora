;; summary:Glamora Fashion Platform NFT Contract that complies with SIP-009 

;; description: This is the main NFT contract for the Glamora fashion platform that handles minting,
;; trading, and managing fashion-related NFTs. It Implements the SIP-009 standard to ensure
;; compatibility with NFT marketplaces and wallets. 

;; version: 3.0

;; author: "Timothy Terese Chimbiv"

;; Let's implement the trait we defined
(impl-trait .sip-009.nft-trait)

;;========================================
;; CONSTANTS
;;========================================

(define-constant ERR-NOT-NFT-OWNER (err u200)) ;; The caller is not the owner of this NFT
(define-constant ERR-TRANSFER-FAILED (err u201)) ;; When sBTC or NFT transfer operation fails

(define-constant ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED (err u202)) ;; The caller is not authorized, 
;; the error triggers if the caller is not the .main contract

(define-constant ERR-INVALID-COLLECTION-NAME (err u203)) ;; when an invalid collection name is provided, 
;; either the collection name is empty or too short
 
(define-constant ERR-INVALID-INPUT (err u204)) ;; its for general invalid inputs like empty description or max-editions out of range (0 or >10,000)

(define-constant ERR-STORAGE-FAILED (err u205)) ;; When saving data to storage contract fails

(define-constant COLLECTION-CREATION-FEE u5000000) ;; Collection creation fee 0.05 sBTC

;; COLLECTION SIZE LIMITS
;; @desc: These set the rules for how big or small a fashion collection can be
;; MIN-COLLECTION-SIZE: The smallest number of NFTs allowed in one collection
;; I set this to 1 because a collection needs at least 1 item to count
;; MAX-COLLECTION-SIZE: The largest number of NFTs allowed in one collection 
;; set this to 10,000 to prevent spam attacks and keep collections manageable
(define-constant MIN-COLLECTION-SIZE u1)      ;; every collection must have at least 1 NFT
(define-constant MAX-COLLECTION-SIZE u10000)  ;; no collection can have more than 10,000 NFTs

;;========================================
;; PLATFORM STATE VARIABLES
;;========================================

(define-data-var total-nfts-minted uint u0) ;; this function will keep track of the total NFTs that's been minted,
;; initially starts at 0 and increases with each new mint

(define-data-var next-collection-id uint u1) ;; next-collection-id tracks the ID for the next fashion collection 
;; it starts at 1 and increases with each new collection assigning unique IDs

(define-data-var authorized-caller principal tx-sender) ;; This will set the initial authorized caller to the deployer principal 
;; giving room for flexibility to update via set-authorized-caller to a contract like .main
;; avoiding tight coupling and enabling upgrades without redeployment

(define-data-var admin principal tx-sender) ;; This function will save the person who deployed the contract (tx-sender)
;; it will identify the person who has admin or the permission to call this contract

;;=======================================
;; READ-ONLY FUNCTIONS FOR PLATFORM DATA
;;=======================================

;; GET TOTAL NFTS MINTED
;; @desc: this function will show how many NFTs that's been minted so far on the platform
(define-read-only (get-total-nfts-minted)
    (var-get total-nfts-minted) ;; it will return the current count of all minted NFTs
)

;; GET NEXT COLLECTION ID
;; @desc: this function will tell us what number the next collection will get
(define-read-only (get-next-collection-id)
    (var-get next-collection-id) ;; it will return the ID that will be used for the next collection
)

;; GET AUTHORIZED CALLER
;; @desc: this function shows who is allowed to create collections and do important operations on the platform
(define-read-only (get-authorized-caller)
    (var-get authorized-caller) ;; it will return the address of whoever can call special functions
)

;; GET ADMIN
;; @desc: this function shows who the owner of this contract is
(define-read-only (get-admin)
    (var-get admin) ;; it will return the address of the contract admin/owner
)

;; CHECK IF SOMEONE IS THE ADMIN
;; @desc: this function checks if a particular person calling this function is the admin
(define-read-only (is-admin (caller principal))
    ;; we'll compare the given address with the stored admin address
    (is-eq caller (var-get admin)) 
) ;; it will return true if they match and false if they don't

;; CHECK IF SOMEONE IS AUTHORIZED
;; @desc: this function checks if a specific person can create collections
;; here we are checking if this person have permission to add new collections, is the person authorized 
(define-read-only (is-caller-authorized (caller principal))
    ;; we'll compare the given address with the authorized caller address
    (is-eq caller (var-get authorized-caller)) 
) ;; it will return true if they match and false if they don't

;;=======================================
;; HELPER FUNCTIONS - READ-ONLY
;;=======================================

;; @desc: this function will enable external contract check who is authorized to call
;; Since no changes will be made just a check hence I used a read-only for the helper function
(define-read-only (is-authorized-caller)
    ;; check that the caller is admin
    (is-eq tx-sender (var-get admin))
)

;; @desc: this function will enable external contracts to check if a collection name is valid
;; Since no changes will be made just a validation check hence I used a read-only for the helper function
(define-read-only (is-valid-collection-name (name (string-utf8 32)))
    ;; check that the collection name is not empty
    (> (len name) u0)
)

;; @desc: this checks how many NFTs are left to mint in a collection
;; - and it returns the number of nfts still available to mint
;; @param: collection-id - the collection we need to check

;;=======================================
;; ADMIN FUNCTIONS
;;=======================================
;; SET AUTHORIZED CALLER
;; @desc: this function allows the admin to change who is authorized to create collections
;; only the admin (person who deployed the contract) can do this
;; @param: new-caller - the wallet address of the new person/contract to authorize
(define-public (set-authorized-caller (new-caller principal))
    (let
        (
            ;; let's save the current authorized caller before we change it

;; NFT TOKEN DEFINITION
;;=======================================

(define-non-fungible-token glamora-nft uint)

;;=======================================
;; SIP-009 TRAIT IMPLEMENTATION
;;=======================================

;; GET LAST TOKEN ID
;; @desc: This will tell us how many NFTs minted by giving the first NFT minted #1 
;; and the next after that one #2, then #3, #4, and so on
;; So if we've minted 5 NFTs, this returns 5 (which is also the last token ID)
(define-read-only (get-last-token-id)
    (ok (var-get total-nfts-minted))
)
;; get-last-token-id will return total-nfts-minted which is perfect because 
;; it tells us the highest NFT ID that exists

;; GET TOKEN URI
;; @desc: This function will get the web link where NFT details are stored like getting a website URL
;; If the NFT exists by the number that was inputted (token-id) 
;; then it returns IPFS hash and the wallets can show the picture
(define-read-only (get-token-uri (token-id uint))

;; GET OWNER
;; @desc: This function tells us who owns a specific NFT by giving it an NFT ID number like #1, #2, #3
;; It will check our NFT ownership records and returns the wallet address of whoever owns that NFT
;; and eturns none if the NFT doesn't exist
(define-read-only (get-owner (token-id uint))
    (ok (nft-get-owner? glamora-nft token-id))
)

;; TRANSFER
;;  @desc: This functions ensures the moving of an NFT from one wallet to another
;; and only the current owner of the NFT can initiate this transfer.
;; @param:
;; - token id 
;; - sender 
;; - recipient
(define-public (transfer (token-id uint) (sender principal) (recipient principal))
